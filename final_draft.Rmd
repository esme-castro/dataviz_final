<!-- Working on fiscal data here -->
Did Daniel show you a way to get around these large file sizes? We need all years of that fiscal data in one df that can be joined to grad_rates (after we merge CLASS data too) to make our finaized df.
```{r fiscal-data}
fiscal10 <- get_data("NCES_CCD_fiscal_district_2010") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() # Esme, this is JUST 2010 fiscal data. It is a huge data set... We still need to import and merge all of these together and then to other dataset... Didn't Dr. Anderson show you how to get around this??

## Zach, I see what you mean, I will email Anderson and ask if he recommends
## making it into parquet files before merging or not. Also if we need to
## expand our R memory when using the data.

fiscal11 <- get_data("NCES_CCD_fiscal_district_2011") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

fiscal_df <- get_fiscal_data()

arrow::write_parquet(fiscal_df, here::here("data", "fiscal_df.parquet"))


## using code below as reference for fiscal data, do not remove yet #####
# first read in the data
class <- import(here("data", "Class20032019.xlsx")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

# write it out as a parquet file
arrow::write_parquet(class, here::here("data", "Class20032019.parquet"))

# read it in again
class2 <- arrow::read_parquet(here::here("data", "Class20032019.parquet"))
```


<!-- ignore below code chunk, this was trying to get geo data, use first code chunk above instead of final project data -->
################## Below is what I have tried to do to merge all data ###########

#join state_data with class_grads

#class_grads.1 <- left_join(class_grads, maps, by = "state") 

# DO NOT NEED THIS IF WE CANNOT FIGURE OUT GEO DATA FRAME SIZE ISSUE
# if this is simply too large, we may have to try and work by creating plots using two separate dataframes? class_grads and state_data
```

```{r}
# FULL DATA FRAME without geographic info. Therefore, if using this, we will not be able to make maps of data viz

# 1 - Add regions data (already done with z1.regions) and color based on regions

# 2 - If I can find a way to compress class df to just one value of timehs per state (year 2011, since the grad_rate data is just 2011), I can add a shape aesthetic so that each state then has a color for region and a shape for what category of class$timehs2. Of course, we would still have the national average highlighted, would have names of states that fall below national average in once color, those that fall above in another color. 
# Want to move the legends to the top left of inside the plot itself. 
# add descriptive title, subtitle, legend name, x and y labs, caption for data source and notes about missing data.
# ideally, color code the subtitle to with region names corresponding to colors in legend
# remove the midpoint vertical lines, just leave major gridlines

```

__Would be cool to have a separate plot from all of this data that just shows something like college drop-out rate by state, or something to show that although some states have high high school graduation rates, they may not be indicative of content learned and/or success after high school __
