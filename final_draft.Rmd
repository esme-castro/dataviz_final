Did Daniel show you a way to get around these large file sizes? We need all years of that fiscal data in one df that can be joined to grad_rates (after we merge CLASS data too) to make our finaized df.
```{r fiscal-data}
fiscal10 <- get_data("NCES_CCD_fiscal_district_2010") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() # Esme, this is JUST 2010 fiscal data. It is a huge data set... We still need to import and merge all of these together and then to other dataset... Didn't Dr. Anderson show you how to get around this??

## Zach, I see what you mean, I will email Anderson and ask if he recommends
## making it into parquet files before merging or not. Also if we need to
## expand our R memory when using the data.

fiscal11 <- get_data("NCES_CCD_fiscal_district_2011") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

```

################## Below is what I have tried to do to merge all data###########
``` {r} 
class <- import(here("data", "Class20032019.xlsx")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() # CLASS Data Set
class <- class %>% 
  rename(fips = stfips,
         state_abbr = state) # make class data a fips that matches grad_rates df, same with the state abbreviation.
class <- class %>% 
  select(1:3, 6, 18, 47)

grad_rates <- get_data("EDFacts_acgr_lea_2011_2019") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() # graduation rates (and cohorts)
grad_rates <- grad_rates %>% 
  mutate(fips = readr::parse_number(fipst)) #rename fipst to fips
grad_rates <- grad_rates %>% 
  select(1:8, 10, 12:27, 30)

# join grad_rates and CLASS
class_grads <- left_join(grad_rates, class, by = "fips") 
  # class df w/ grad rates_state
class_grads <- class_grads %>% 
  rename(state = stnam) # to match map df
class_grads <- class_grads %>% 
  mutate(state = tolower(state)) # to match maps df

# add state mapping data
maps <- map_data("state") %>% # ggplot2::map_data
  rename(state = region) %>% 
  select(1:5)

# state regions to maps df
state_info <- readr::read_csv("https://github.com/kjhealy/fips-codes/raw/master/state_fips_master.csv") #state data with fipst

state_info <- subset(state_info, select = c(1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10))
# just want the columns with unrepeated information to class_grad that can be used later (example: regions and divisions)

state_info <- state_info %>% 
   mutate(state_name = tolower(state_name)) %>% 
    rename(state = state_name)

maps <- left_join(state_info, maps, by = "state")

#join state_data with class_grads
# this works, but the df is so large that you cannot view the df.
class_grads.1 <- left_join(class_grads, maps, by = "state")
# if this is simply too large, we may have to try and work by creating plots using two separate dataframes? class_grads and state_data
